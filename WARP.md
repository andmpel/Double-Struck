# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## High-level code architecture

This is a simple web application with three main files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page. It includes a text area for input, a button to trigger the conversion, and a div to display the output.
*   `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the logic of the application. It listens for a click event on the "Convert" button, gets the text from the input area, converts it to double-struck characters, and displays the result in the output area.
*   `style.css`: This file contains the CSS rules for styling the web page.

## How to run the application

To run this application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
